When answering Rust questions, always open the latest docs on docs.rs for any mentioned crate
using the `â€¦/latest/` link (e.g., https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/), and prefer the crate's
README on crates.io or the GitHub repo when needed. If code examples differ from my local
versions, explain version differences and show the latest API usage.

For any ambiguous API, search:
1) docs.rs/<crate>/latest
2) crates.io/<crate> (homepage/repository links)
3) The crate's CHANGELOG or RELEASES
